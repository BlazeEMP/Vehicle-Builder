  ## Installation

  - Download all files in the project  
  - Make sure you have Node working in your development environment/console  
  - Easy to run in something like VSCode console with the project open if you don't have a environment installed yet

  ## Usage

  * Go to the location of the index.ts file and open your console
  * Once you've opened the console use `npm start` to generate the JS files and run the program. There are prebuilt vehicles to use or you can create your own.

  ## Contributing

  No contribution required, this is a practice and example project, if you wish to use it for practice or experimentation fork or clone the repository. If you believe a change should be made, feel free to email me directly at the address given in the questions section.

  ## Tests

  To test the program simply run it and check each action choice and it's output (you will have to view the code for expected outputs), or verify that each typed value input is read and used in a constructor (print details on created vehicle.) If you enter nothing for wheel information a default object should be created for however many wheels are required for the given vehicle type (wheels specifically are the only thing that will fill in default values in the given state.)
